<hr/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This collection of scripts can be used to control iTunes.
 You can use them from the command line, in a batch (command) file, or you
 can assign them to the special controls keys on a multimedia keyboard (such
 as "Play", "Next", or "Previous").</p>

<p>These scripts are free.  If you find them useful, please consider registering at the
 <a href="http://www.maximized.com/freeware/ScriptsForiTunes/">Maximized Software web site</a>.
 Registering will let you keep up to date on enhancements to these scripts, as well
 as provide an opportunity to send us comments on them, or to suggest other iTunes or iPod products.</p>

<p>These scripts only require iTunes (not an iPod). You can always download the latest version
 of iTunes from <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">the iTunes website</a>.</p>

<p><em>iTunes</em> and <em>iPod</em> are registered trademarks of Apple Computer, Inc.
 <em>Scripts for iTunes</em> is a trademark of Maximized Software, Inc.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To install Scripts for iTunes, simply run the setup program (setup.exe).  You will
 be asked where to install the scripts.  Choose any folder that you desire.  By default,
 setup will place the scripts into a new folder named Scripts that it creates in
 C:\Program Files\iTunes.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Using the scripts</h2>

<p>Most people will want to use the scripts to control iTunes via their multimedia keyboard.
 To do this, open the configuration utility that came with your computer or keyboard.
 For example, on a Dell computer this utility is called DellTouch, and can be started
 (under Windows XP) by clicking on the Start button, choosing All Programs, choosing Accessories,
 choose System Tools, and finally choosing DellTouch.  You may also have a small icon in the
 Windows system tray that looks like a key cap; clicking on this icon may bring up the configuration
 utility.</p>

<p>Once you have the configuration utility open, use it to configure the keys that you would
 like to use to control iTunes.  For example, with the DellTouch utility, you would click on
 the picture of a button such as Play.  This opens a window which lets you configure this button.
 Choose the option to specify an application to run, and browse to the desired script.  You may
 also need to change the text assigned to the button label.</p>

<p>The directions for configuring your system may be different.  For example, Microsoft multimedia
 keyboards are configured with the Keyboard applet of the Control Panel.</p>

<p>Here are a list of the recommended keyboard mappings to make:</p>

<table border="1">

<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Script</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Play / Pause</td>
<td>C:\Program Files\iTunes\Scripts\PlayPause.vbs</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Previous</td>
<td>C:\Program Files\iTunes\Scripts\BackTrack.vbs</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Next</td>
<td>C:\Program Files\iTunes\Scripts\Next.vbs</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Stop</td>
<td>C:\Program Files\iTunes\Scripts\Stop.vbs</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>It is <em>not</em> recommended to reconfigure the volume control keys (up, down, mute)
 to use Scripts for iTunes.  The scripts will affect the volume within iTunes only, and
 will not affect any other sounds played on your PC.  Instead, you should let the
 multimedia volume keys continue to operate your entire sound card as they normally do.</p>

<p>To use the scripts from the command line or in a batch file, simply call the script
 as you would any other program.  See the description of each script below for details
 on its syntax and any parameters it may support or require.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Uninstall</h2>

<p>To uninstall Scripts for iTunes, open the Control Panel, choose Add / Remove Programs,
 then select Scripts for iTunes and click on Remove.</p>

<p>If you have configured keys on your multimedia keyboard to use the scripts, you
 will need to reconfigure the keys after removing the scripts.</p>

<p>Normally you will want to keep iTunes set to its maximum
 volume and adjust your sound card's volume or muting using the
 normal mapping of your multimedia keyboard.  Therefore,
 use of this script to control iTunes muting is
 not recommended (unless you've got a special need in mind).</p>

<h3>PlaySong.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This script will cause iTunes play the specified song. You must specify the song name.
 In addition, you can also specify the artist or album if desired.</p>

<p>If you only specify the song name, then you do not need to use the <strong>/song:</strong> prefix.

<p>If the desired resides in several different playlists, you can control which
 playlist is selected by using the <strong>/playlist:</strong> parameter.  If you
 do not specify a playlist name, then the song will be played from the normal Library.
 If you specify a playlist, then the song will be played from the specified playlist,
 and when the song has finished then the specified playlist will continue playing.</p>

<p>Note that this script supports partial matches, so several tracks might
 match the song, album, or artist name.  You can specify as many parameters as necessary
 to indicate which specific track you want to play.</p>

<hr/>
<a name="Previous"></a>
<h3>Previous.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This script tells iTunes to play the previous track.
 Note that this will always move to the previous track,
 regardless of the position within the current track.
 You can use the script <a href="#BackTrack">BackTrack</a> to use the "back track"
 feature of iTunes, which restarts the current track if you're
 at least a few seconds into it, or goes to the previous track
 if you're within the first few seconds of the current track.
</p>

<h4>Syntax:</h4>

</p>

<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<p>Rewind</p>


<hr/>
<a name="ScriptEngineCache-Start"></a>
<h3>ScriptEngineCache-Start.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>You may want to use this script if you find that your system sometimes takes a while to run
 the script that you have associated with a key on a multimedia keyboard.</p>

<p>This script runs silently in a continuous loop, thus keeping the Windows Script Host loaded in
 memory.  On some systems, this might make subsequent scripts mapped to the keys on a multimedia
 keyboard execute more quickly because the Windows Script Host is already loaded in memory.</p>

<p>This script works by setting a flag in the registry, then checking for the existence of the
 flag every five seconds.  This script sleeps in-between checking the registry, so it should have
 no noticeable effect on system performance.</p>

<p>To stop this script from running, just run the
 <a href="#ScriptEngineCache-Stop">ScriptEngineCache-Stop</a> script.
 The ScriptEngineCache-Stop script will clear the flag in the registry which
 tells the ScriptEngineCache-Start script to keep running.</p>

<p>Please note that some utilities may warn you that this script is attempting to
 write to the registry.  You may need to tell these utilities that it is okay for
 this script to execute normally.</p>

<p>You may want to add a shortcut to this script to your Startup menu to ensure that it is
 always running.</p>

<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<p>ScriptEngineCache-Start</p>


<hr/>
<a name="ScriptEngineCache-Stop"></a>
<h3>ScriptEngineCache-Stop.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Running this script will cause the <a href="#ScriptEngineCache-Start">ScriptEngineCache-Start</a> script
 to stop running.</p>

<p>See the <a href="#ScriptEngineCache-Start">ScriptEngineCache-Start</a> script for more details.</p>

<p>Please note that some utilities may warn you that this script is attempting to
 write to the registry.  You may need to tell these utilities that it is okay for
 this script to execute normally.</p>

<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<p>ScriptEngineCache-Stop</p>


<hr/>
<a name="SetVolume"></a>
<h3>SetVolume.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This script sets the volume within iTunes.
 Note that this is a different volume control than
 that provided by your sound card (which can be easily
 accessed by double-clicking on the speaker icon in the
 system tray).</p>

<p>Normally you will want to keep iTunes set to its maximum
 volume and adjust your sound card's volume using the
 normal mapping of your multimedia keyboard.  Therefore,
 use of this script to control the iTunes volume is
 not recommended (unless you've got a special need in mind).</p>

<p>The iTunes volume ranges from 0 to 100. You can use this script
 with a given number to set the volume at a specific level, or precede
 the number with a + or - to indicate a relative amount of change.</p>

<p>Also see the <a href="#VolumeUp">VolumeUp</a> and <a href="#VolumeDown">VolumeDown</a> scripts.</p>

<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<p>SetVolume [+|-]<em>number</em></p>

<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<table border="1">

<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SetVolume 0</td>
<td>Sets volume to "off" (but not the same as "mute")</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SetVolume 100</td>
<td>Sets volume to highest possible value</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SetVolume 50</td>
<td>Sets volume to 50 (ie, half)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>SetVolume -10</td>
<td>Turns volume down by 10 points</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p></p>


<hr/>
<a name="Stop"></a>
<h3>Stop.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This script stops iTunes, regardless of its current mode.
 Note that "stopping" means that iTunes will stop any playback
 and return to the beginning of the current track.
 Of course, this is different than pausing.
</p>

<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<p>Stop</p>


<hr/>
<a name="VolumeDown"></a>
<h3>VolumeDown.vbs</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>This script decrements the volume within iTunes by 10 points.
